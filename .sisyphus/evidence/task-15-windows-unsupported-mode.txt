Task: 15. Windows MSI E2E verification wave
Environment: Linux (no Windows registry subsystem)
Date: 2026-02-17

Failure-mode / unsupported-mode evidence
---------------------------------------
1) Attempted required verifier execution:
   Command: pwsh -File scripts/verify_installer_windows.ps1
   Output: /usr/sbin/bash: line 1: pwsh: command not found

2) PowerShell runtime availability check:
   Command: which pwsh
   Output: which: no pwsh in (...PATH...)

3) Deterministic non-Windows behavior in verifier source:
   File: scripts/verify_installer_windows.ps1
   Lines:
     if (-not $IsWindows) {
         Write-Output 'RESULT|UNSUPPORTED|reason=windows-only verification script executed on non-windows environment'
         exit 2
     }

Conclusion:
- Real Windows execution is not possible in this environment.
- Unsupported path is deterministic by script contract (RESULT|UNSUPPORTED + exit 2).
